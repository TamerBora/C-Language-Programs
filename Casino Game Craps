//A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces. These faces contain 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6
//spots. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins. If the sum is 2, 3,
//or 12 on the first throw (called “craps”), the player loses (i.e., the “house” wins). If the
//sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 on the first throw, then that sum becomes the player’s
//“point.” To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you “make your point.” The
//player loses by rolling a 7 before making the point.
